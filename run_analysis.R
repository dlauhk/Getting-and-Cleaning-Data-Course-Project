# Smartphone Motion Testing - Data Management (cleaning & consolidation)
#1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
#2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
#3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
#5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
